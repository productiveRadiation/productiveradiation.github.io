						<p>Nil's Fine Game is an action-RPG developed by tayN. It revolves around a mentally ill teenager named PEDRO RICHARD PETERS and him learning how to communicate. Oh, and reclaim the position of a god. The game includes mental apparitions (She), umbrella women, communication and more! Or maybe not communication, if you're that kind of person.</p>

						<p>But before you can do any of that, you got a chore to do.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>The game's still in development, but it has become one of my favourites after playing the demo. It's charming, funny, a bit pessimistic and kind of cute. tayN and his team have done a great job making this game the best it can be. If you're a fan of games like "Earthbound", "Chrono Trigger" or heck even "LISA", this game might be up your alley.</p>
