                    <span>Hey, folks. It's been a while. A few weeks ago, Cosmic told me that he would be leaving Productive Radiation. You might know him from his pixel-art and some games he published. There are no hard feelings, I think of him as a great guy and you should consider indulging yourself in his work. Productive Radiation will still continue with only Jayaks and I (Atomyiik). Thank you for reading.</span>
