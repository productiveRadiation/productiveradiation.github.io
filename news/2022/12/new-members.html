	<p>Productive Radiation has been pretty active recently, with our gears finally started to turn. With that, we'd like to announce that Ellie (kidwithadrawingmouse) and Hilda (stoic-rose) have joined Productive Radiation! You may know them from some of Alice's Tumblr posts. Ellie and Hilda are both artists that fit nicely in this little oddball of a group. We also have some new forums! I repurposed the Cosmo Setter Forums to become the Productive Radiation forums. It now runs on phpBB 2.2 instead of SMF 2.1.2. The boards link is a redirect, which is to prevent link rot.</p>
	<p>Thank you for sticking with us all of this time. Hope to see you soon!</p>
