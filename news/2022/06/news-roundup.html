        <h2>"News Roundup"</h2>
        <p style="font-size: smaller;">07 JUNE 2022 BY <a href="mailto:ocfromatomyiik@mail.com">ATOMYIIK</a></p>
        <p>Quite a few things happened during this week, so here's the scoop!</p>
        <h3>AN ENTIRE WEBSITE REDESIGN NOW FINISHED. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.</h3>
        <img src="../../../blog/beforeandafter.png" title="GLOSSY, BEAUTIFUL FINISH.">
        <p>I've finally finished the website redesign. It took like, two days. I noticed the website did really look too hot in smaller dimensions, so that's really the main reason I made the update (see picture below).</p>
        <img src="../../../blog/beforeandafter_2.png" title="In the worst cases, it could even look like this...">
        <p style="font-size: smaller;">In the worst cases, it could even look like this...</p>
        <p>Hopefully, this redesign will help out those on their mobile devices or with smaller screens!</p>
        <img src="../../../blog/beforeandafter_3.png" title="We 100% totally get along with smartphones now.">
        <p>(We also now have a <a href="https://productiveradiation.tumblr.com" target="_blank">TUMBLR BLOG</a> run and set up by <a href="Mailto:jayaksiguess@gmail.com" target="_blank"><i>Jay</i></a>. Thank you!)</p>
        <h3>Uproots added to the website</h3>
        <a href="../../../uproots/"><img src="../../../blog/uproots.png"></a>
        <p>I (<a href="mailto:ocfrommmakesstuff@hotmail.com">ocfrom</a>) added a Uproots section at the request of Jay. Uproots is a surreal RPG being developed by Jay (and some other people I think including me). It has a really cool soundtrack (seriously, listen to <a href="https://file.garden/YpDooICqGHPlp9Hw/music/jasper-s-theme.mp3" target="_blank">this</a>!) and I think it'll be a great idea to play it when it comes out.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading this roundup! More things are to come from Productive Radiation!</p>
