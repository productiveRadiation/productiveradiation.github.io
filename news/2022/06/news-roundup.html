                    <br>
                    <span>Quite a few things happened during this week, so here's the scoop!</span>
                    <h3>AN ENTIRE WEBSITE REDESIGN NOW FINISHED. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.</h3>
                    <img src="../../../img/news/beforeandafter.gif" title="GLOSSY, BEAUTIFUL FINISH.">
                    <span>I've finally finished the website redesign. It took like, two days. I noticed the website did really look too hot in smaller dimensions, so that's really the main reason I made the update (see picture below).</span>
                    <img src="../../../img/news/beforeandafter_2.gif" title="In the worst cases, it could even look like this...">
                    <span>Hopefully, this redesign will help out those on their mobile devices or with smaller screens!</span>
                    <img src="../../../img/news/beforeandafter_3.gif" title="Why the hell would you browse this website on a flip-phone?">
                    <br>
                    <span>(We also now have a <a href="https://productiveradiation.tumblr.com" target="_blank">TUMBLR BLOG</a> run and set up by <a href="mailto:jayaksiguess@gmail.com" target="_blank"><i>Jay</i></a>. Thank you!)</span>
                    <h3>Uproots added to the website</h3>
                    <a href="../../../uproots/"><img src="../../../img/news/uproots.gif"></a>
                    <br>
                    <span>I added an Uproots section at the request of Jay. Uproots is a surreal RPG being developed by Jay (and some other people I think including me). It has a really cool soundtrack (seriously, listen to <a href="https://file.garden/YpDooICqGHPlp9Hw/music/jasperstheme.mp3" target="_blank">this</a>!) and I think it'll be a great idea to play it when it comes out.</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>Thanks for reading this roundup! More things are to come from Productive Radiation!</span>
