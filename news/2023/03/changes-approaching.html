                    <span>After weeks of frantically programming and some slacking off, version 2.42 of the Productive Radiation website and the forums are DONE! My fingers can finally rest. This new design should keep compatibility with text-only web browsers like Lynx and Links, while looking better on graphical web browsers. The forums should now be functional and serve as a central hub for all things ProRad. They still have a lot of rough edges which I'm still fixing, though.</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>Hope you all enjoy!</span>
