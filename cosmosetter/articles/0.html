						<h3>New Website Design and Game Information</h3>
						<span style="font-size: smaller;">25 July 2022</span>
						<hr>
                    				<p>Hello, netizens! I updated the website with new sections and a blog. I hope this makes it easier to find information about the game.</p>
                    				<p>Also, some people have been wondering what has happened to Cosmo Setter with the abrupt lack of updates. Sorry about that :p</p>
                    				<p>I decided to take the development more private as a lot about the game is constantly changing and evolving. So at this moment, the game is <b class="blog-entry">on hold</b>. But I haven't completely stopped work on it. A lot of behind-the-scenes planning and design has been occurring to properly restart the game.</p>
                    				<p>And now, I'll answer some questions in more detail.</p>
                    				<hr>
                    				<h3>Question: What happened to Catco's Galaxy RUST?</h3>
                    				<p>I rebranded it as Cosmo Setter, as it makes more sense. And frankly, "Catco's Galaxy RUST" sounds really silly.</p>
                    				<h3>Question: Will the game still be released in "chapters", or as a full the game?</h3>
                    				<p>Only as a full game. I only chose the "chapters" method to make development of the game faster, but I have realised that going with this style would make the quality between different chapters drastic.</p>
                    				<h3>Question: What's the fate of "Fan" characters?</h3>
                    				<p>All fan characters submitted via the form in April 2021 scrapped, I simply feel like this would dilute the personal aspect of the game to me. The only characters being used that have been created by another person are ones designed by <a href="https://gamejolt.com/@Caro_" target="_blank">Caro_</a>.</p>
                    				<h3>Question: When do you think the game will be finished?</h3>
                    				<p>In 2-4 years. This is a hobby project, so I am taking my time with it.</p>
		    				<hr>
                    				<p>Anyway, that's it for now. Thank you for reading the article!</p>
